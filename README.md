# Calculator Implementation

Here are three calculators implementation that look and function exactly the same but with vastly different implementions techniques.

1. **Procedural Javascript** - This example uses traditional DOM manipulation and function based javascript programming to implement various features

2. **Class Based Typescript** - This example uses object orientated programming to model and implement various features and type safety

3. **React & Typescript** - This example uses React component based structure to implement the various features and Typescript for type safety
